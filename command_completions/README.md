# command completions

url-completion works by modifying completion scripts for specific commands.

In this directory you will find specific installations scripts for each command.

In the future, if you wish to add a completion to use url completions for a command that doesn't exist here, you can add those here, with each going in its own folder.

# Available completions:

- [git](./git/)
